            <h3>Who are <span class="highlight">we</span></h3>
        <p>In 2014, Helle Martens, inspired by a twist of fate, launched the conference after an accident left her jobless. Within a year, her idea of hosting a UX and design conference became a reality, with 144 tickets sold for the inaugural event in March 2015. </p>

    <h3><span class="highlight">Theme</span></h3>
    <div class="text_grid">
        <div>
        <p>The theme for UX Copenhagen 2024 is: Degrowth and Consumerism.</p>
        <p>For far too long, we have been living in a world that applauds and encourages continuous growth, expansion, selling, and manipulation. It's a world of overproduction and overconsumption, but we're running out of resources. Business as usual will not cut it anymore.</p>
   
        </div>
   <p>We'll delve into climate change, consumerism, waste, and the necessity of transitioning from harmful production and development. We'll explore the concept of degrowth, discuss the essential shift needed in consumerism for planetary survival, showcase our past sustainable projects, and initiate a dialogue on the role of designers in driving systemic, sustainable change.</p>

        <p>Online networking and interaction
            We’re doing everything we can to support networking during our virtual events.  </p>
        <p> <strong>ROUND TABLE SESSIONS</strong> – Intimate online rooms with few participants. Get to know the speakers!
            Most of this year’s speakers, along with a number of previous speakers, will be hosting small 1-hour group sessions with only 6-8 participants.</p> 
        </div>
        <div>
        <p><strong>CHATROOMS WITH SOME OF OUR SPONSORS AND PARTNERS</strong>– Hop in for some networking and fun activities during our breaks!
            Some of our partners will be hosting chatrooms and virtual “booths” with different activities for you to take part in during our breaks. Check out a demo of their products, join in on raffles and other give-aways, and network with other conference participants.
        </p>  
        <p>In 2020, we also started a new initiative: a series of conversations with what we call “Conversations with UX Copenhagen”.</p>
